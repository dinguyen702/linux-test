Here's how you can take the FPGA DMA channels out of reset in uboot.
This has to be done for the fpga-dma test to work.

First, you stop at the uboot prompt, then do the following commands:

SOCFPGA_CYCLONE5 # md ffd05018 1
ffd05018: 000000ff    ....
SOCFPGA_CYCLONE5 # mw ffd05018 fc
SOCFPGA_CYCLONE5 # md ffd05018 1 
ffd05018: 000000fc    ....
SOCFPGA_CYCLONE5 # run bootcmd
